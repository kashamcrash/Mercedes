# Mercedes Benz Dataset

## Task in Hand
Reduce the Time a Mercedes-Benz spends on the Test Bench with PCA.

### Points to Consider
* If for any column(s), the variance is equal to zero, then you need to remove those variable(s).
* Check for null and unique values for test and train sets
* Apply label encoder.
* Perform dimensionality reduction.
* Predict your test_df values using xgboost
